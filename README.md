# digital-diary-.-

This project is a command-line digital diary system built entirely using Python and CSV files. It allows users to create, store, and organize personal journal entries with titles, moods, timestamps, and tags. The diary supports powerful features such as text search, tag/mood filtering, entry viewing, and automatic statistics like monthly activity and mood trends. All data is stored in a single CSV file, making the system lightweight, portable, and easy to analyze. Optional password protection ensures privacy without relying on external libraries.
